# Consolidated service routes

Nginx Proxy Manager is Compose-owned by `infra-services` and persists at
`/srv/appdata/docker/infra-nginx-proxy-manager`. The route mapping in
`update-consolidated-routes.sql` remains the Git-managed recovery definition
for the service consolidation performed before the Compose migration.

Back up
`/srv/appdata/docker/infra-nginx-proxy-manager/data/database.sqlite`, apply the
SQL with `sqlite3`, verify `PRAGMA integrity_check`, then regenerate the
affected proxy files through NPM. Validate with `nginx -t` before reloading
Nginx.

The original `proxy_data` and `proxy_letsencrypt` named volumes and
`rpool/appdata/docker@pre-infra-migration-20260723` remain rollback assets.
